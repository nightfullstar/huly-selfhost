# Setup Script Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "Failed to fetch" Error in Docker Environment
**Problem**: The setup script defaulted to `localhost` for `HOST_ADDRESS`, which doesn't work in Docker containers because each container has its own localhost.

**Solution**: 
- Changed default from `localhost` to the actual machine IP address (detected via `hostname -I`)
- This allows containers to reach the reverse proxy using the host machine's IP

### 2. Port Configuration Issues
**Problem**: The script always defaulted to port 80, which requires root privileges and isn't suitable for local development.

**Solution**:
- Use port 8083 as default for localhost/IP address setups (non-privileged)
- Use port 80 as default only for domain names
- Only append port to HOST_ADDRESS when it's not the standard port 80

### 3. Missing .env File Creation
**Problem**: The setup script created docker-compose.yml with environment variables but didn't create the .env file needed for Docker Compose variable substitution.

**Solution**:
- Added .env file creation at the end of setup script
- Includes all necessary environment variables with proper comments
- Makes the configuration more transparent and editable

### 4. Improved User Experience
**Improvements**:
- Better default values based on setup type (local vs domain)
- Clear success message with access URL
- Helpful comments explaining the configuration choices

## Files Modified
- `setup.sh`: Main setup script with all improvements

## Benefits
1. **Eliminates "Failed to fetch" errors** in fresh installations
2. **Works out-of-the-box** for local development without requiring root privileges
3. **Creates proper .env file** for easier configuration management
4. **Better user guidance** with improved defaults and messages

## Backward Compatibility
- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing configurations continue to work
- Only improves the default behavior for new setups
